# AlgoritmTimeComparison
This is simple c++ code made for comparing time complexity of two algorithms. For example here is implemented horner vs classical polynomial evaluation.

## What this code does?
* Tests the functions for the equal results
* Generates random data
* Measures execution time of given function
* Outputs results to the file
* Returns time in human-readable units like ns, ms, sec, min
